# ScapeNeRF

ScapeNeRF is an on-going effort to revolutionize the real estate marketplace by rendering high-quality, 3D renders of real estate from images captured from a mobile device. The project utlises Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate the 3D Models and make them interactable. The system is deployed as a mobile application built using Flutter and Firebase.
